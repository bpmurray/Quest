3You are in a small damp cellar.  Some wooden     steps lead up to a trap door in the ceiling.     2
2Part of the east wall has collapsed to reveal a  narrow passage way.                              2

3You are standing on a dull metal floor, in the   middle of a brightly lit room. All around        2
3you are banks of machinery whose thin film of    dust betrays long disuse. The air is warm, with a2
3hint of ozone, and a low humming noise is coming from the one console which is still functioning. 2
3The console comprises a row of eight numbered    buttons and a large lever.  The button labelled  2
2number 1 is illuminated.  There is an airlock    door to the north.                               2
2The lights dim, and a blue glow forms on the     floor. It swirls with a myriad stars.            2
2A lambent pool of shimmering light is dancing    on the floor, before the console.                2

3and obscure apparatus. Hanging from the ceiling  is the mummified body of an alligator, and round 2

3On the bench in front of you is a lodestone whichpoints directly to a heavily barred door which   2
3bears the inscription 'speak friend and enter'.  On the west wall,directly above a set of library 2
2steps, is a heavy glass porthole, next to it is anotice in elfish, which you cannot read.         2

3To the west is an enormously heavy iron door     bearing the rust of ages.  There is a small      2
3notice on the door which reads:                    "The caverns beyond this door are particularly 2
3perilous.  Only the most experienced travellers  should venture forth, and even then in fear and  2
1trembling."                                                                                       2
3A rusty old door to your west lies open, but     a notice on the door advises that:               2
3  "The caverns beyond this door are particularly perilous.  Only the most experienced travellers  2
2should venture forth, and even then in fear and  trembling".                                      2
3The rod hits the door, and as soon as it does so,the great mass starts to creak open on its rusty 2
1old hinges, revealing a doorway to the west.                                                      2
3You are on the south side of the crevasse.  A    path continues southwards, and there is a small  2
1cave to the west.                                                                                 2
2The hinges on the old door are rusted solid, it  will not budge an inch.                          2

3You are in a small featureless chamber.  All the walls and both the floor and ceiling are painted 2
1a clinical white.                                                                                 2

2There is no break in the wall anywhere, not even for a door.                                      2
1The door has just vanished.                                                                       2

3You are in a small dark cave.  There are doors tothe east and west and a rope bridge stretching   2
1over a deep crevasse to the south.                                                                2
3As you have no lamp, you stumbled on the         threshold in the dark and cracked your head on   2
1the solid rock floor.                                                                             2

1The door back to the river is shut.                                                               2
3As you cross the bridge, it starts to shake.  Thevibrations get worse and worse until finally the 2
3worn old ropes can stand it no longer.  They snapsending you plummeting into the unfathomable     2
1depths below.                                                                                     2
2You are in a large chamber whose floor is made ofsolid glass of a deep red hue.                   2
3You are in a small damp cave.  Somewhere in the  distance the steady plink plink of dripping water2
2can be heard, each drop sending echoes           reverberating round the cave.                    2
1You are in the damp cave.                                                                         2
3As you creep southwards, there is suddenly a     massive rock fall which buries you under three   2
1tons of rubble.                                                                                   2
3As you step over the threshold, the great iron   door clangs shut with an alacrity it seems       2
1incapable of.                                    Booms out:  "Oh brave traveller, you have chosen 2

3You are standing next to the railway line.       An alleyway lit by flickering gas lights leads   2
1off to the west.                                                                                  2

3You're at the west end of a dingy alleyway, lit  by flickering gas lamps. There is a sleazy little2
2shop selling surgical appliances and rubber goodsa flyblown sign says "ring and enter".           2
1Could you, perhaps, be a little more specific.                                                    2
1The door is bolted from the other side.                                                           2
2There is the sound of shuffling footsteps, and ofa bolt being drawn back.                         2
1You're in the shop.                                                                               2
3You are in a musty little shop. The shelves roundthe walls are piled high with boxes whose labels 2
3are largely obscured with dust, but you can make out the words 'inflatable dragon : large size'   2
2and 'Gandalf's energiser'. Behind the counter    is a flight of stairs, leading upwards.          2
1Lying on the floor is                                                                             2

2The obese, repulsive body of Nobrain blocks your way. "**** Off, you **** brit **** !" he suggests2
2"Horse ****, bull ****, and all other kinds of   ****, you goddam pinko!"                         2
3Nobrain breaks wind, noisily, rattling the       windows and adding to the already fetid odour    2
2within the shop. This is not a nice place to     bring your granny!                               2

3You are now in the land of the Arborons or tree  folk.  All around you in the dim light,          2
3unblinking pairs of pink eyes can be seen peepingat you through the tree roots.  Arboron burrows  2

3You are now in the Arboron grave yard.  Arboron  corpses in various states of decay are arranged  2
3in neat rows against the north wall and the      stench is appalling.  Welcome gusts of fresh air 2
2can be felt from south and west, whilst an       Arboron burrow leads off to the east.            2
1You are in the Arboron grave yard.                                                                2
2The little cobbled path along which you are      walking turns southwards here.                   2
2On the corner is a small brick building with the name plate "Bert the elf" on the sturdy oak door.2
1You are outside the house of Bert the elf.                                                        2
2The little cobbled path along which you are      walking turns eastwards here.                    2
3The door is opened by Bert, wearing a fine red   cap and olive green suit.  Traditional elf       2
1hospitality being what it is, he invites you in.                                                  2
3You are now in old Bert's house.  The shelves arelined with all manner of strange artifacts       2
3gathered during old Bert's 357 years of life.      "I shall show you some of my more prized       2
2possesions later if you like" says old Bert "willyou stay to tea ?"                               2
3You realise of course that to refuse an          invitation to tea is about the biggest social    2
2snub you can perpetrate in elvish etiquette.       Bert is rightly upset and shows you the door.  2
3Tea is (as always in an elvish household)        magnificent.  The traditional 27 different       2
3courses are all served with the necessary pomp   and ceremony. The dishes range from the piquant  2
3pickled subterranian mushrooms in oak root sauce to the rare and succulent delicacy of boiled     2
3arboron ears in jelly.                             After tea (which lasts some five hours) Bert   2
3takes you through into his back room museum in   which his favourite treasures are housed.        2
3  After browsing for a pleasant half hour among  such rare exhibits as a complete set of coinage  2
3from the reign of elf king Zorgat the large, and an autographed copy of the complete works of     2
3Cedric Dewdrop, Bert wishes you a fond farewell  with a parting gift of a beautiful silver oil    2
2lamp with hand painted scenes of the orient on   it.                                              2

1You're back in the rocket.                                                                        2
1You're at the rocket silo again.                                                                  2

1You're back in the control room.                                                                  2
1You're in the store room.                                                                         2
3You have entered a vast, metal lined silo. Aroundthe walls are flashing lights and huge coloured  2
3displays of orbital paths. Your attention is     transfixed by the sleek form of a rocket, poised 2
3on a ramp at the top of a flight of steel stairs.Faint wisps of vapour are drifting from the side 2
3of the craft, and from all around you comes the  faint hum of enormous forces waiting to be       2
1unleashed.                                                                                        2
3The motors ignite with a shattering roar, fillingthe silo with white hot gas. At least you didn't 2
1have time to feel much!!!!                                                                        2
3The rocket smashes into the great steel doors in the roof of the silo. As the retaining straps of 2
3your seat break under the stress of more than 200'g', you reflect how lucky you are to have       2
1avoided the resulting explosion.                                                                  2
3You are in a small control room, adjoining the   main silo.                                       2
3On the panel before you are a number of          interesting lights and buttons. One is labelled  2
1'UPWISE EGRESS CON'                                                                               2
3The great steel doors in the silo roof rumble    open, revealing a smooth vertical tube, at the   2
1top of which you can see the sky.                                                                 2
3You are strapped in the reclining seat of the    command module of a rocket. Most of the screens  2
2in front of you are blank, but there is a panel  reading 'launch circuits armed'.                 2
1You're in a store room.                                                                           2
1Hanging from a rack in front of you is a                                                          2
1double-breasted pinstripe spacesuit.                                                              2
3The great engines ignite, and the rocket surges  upwards, the acceleration pressing you hard into 2
2your seat. I hope you remembered to remove your  small change from your back pocket!              2
3As your senses slowly recover, after the spell inhigh 'g', you notice that the rocket is in orbit 2
2round the moon. You also notice that there is a  hatch above you, reading 'lunar landing module'. 2
1You're in the landing module.                                                                     2
1You are sitting in the lunar landing module.                                                      2
1You're in the control module.                                                                     2
3In response to your command, the landing module  separates from the main body of the rocket and,  2
3under computer guidance, spirals in towards the  moon. There is a lurch as the retro rockets fire 2
1and when the dust settles, you can see that                                                       2
3You are on the moon's surface. Through the ports,the land is harsh and barren. The sky is pitch   2
2black, but the glare from the rocks makes it     impossible for you to see the stars.             2
3I regret to inform you that you have just        exploded! may I suggest that you don't try it    2
1again, since it may be damaging to your health.                                                   2
1The earth has just disappeared!!!!!!                                                              2
3Look, there doesn't seem to be much point in     prolonging this, actually. Let's just say that   2
3your air ran out. Reincarnation may take a bit   longer this time, since there's all those other  2
1poor beggars to reconstitute as well.                                                             2
1You're standing on the moon.                                                                      2
2You are standing on the surface of the moon.     All is silence, desolation and grey rock.        2
2A selenite just stuck his head above a rock and  looked at you !                                  2
2A selenite sneaked up behind you while you were  admiring the view, and pulled off your air line! 2
1Within easy reach is a                                                                            2
1chunk of lunar rock.                                                                              2
2Mission control recommend that you do not        deviate from the landing area.                   2
2There was only enough fuel for one landing. You  crashed somewhere in the mare crisium!!          2
3With a cloud of dust, and a burst of static in   your helmet, the lunar module takes off. The     2
2surface of the moon drops away like a stone      down a well.                                     2
3You are now in orbit round the moon. A few metresahead of you drifts the angular shape of the     2
1command module.                                                                                   2
3You managed to escape the feeble pull of the     moon's gravity,but lacked the fuel to do anything2
2else. How does it feel to make the world's first solar landing!!                                  2
2You have successfully docked with the command    module. The hatch below you has now opened.      2
3You are back in the command module. Through the  windows, you can see the harsh face of the moon, 2
3far below. The hatch above you is now closed,    and a sign on the control panel reads            2
1'lunar module jettisoned'.                                                                        2
3The main engines fire, blasting you out of lunar orbit and back towards earth. You re-enter on a  2
3column of flame, and as you drop through the     clouds, you can see a road far below. The chutes 2
2open, and you are lowered gently to the ground.  You stumble out of the hatch to find that        2
1The air in your spacesuit just gave out!!!!                                                       2

3You are in what looks like the main street of an old western town.  An icy wind is blowing along  2
3the street from the south, sending the odd ball  of tumbleweed hurtling past.  Above the high     2
3pitched shriek of the wind, the sound of piano   music can be heard from the saloon to the west.  2

3of eight winchester repeater rifles held in placeby a stout oak retaining bar and a large padlock,2

3As you go south, it gets much colder.  An icy    wind is blowing and you must have emerged into   2
1the open air, because it is starting to snow.                                                     2
3You are on a vast snowy plain.  Snow is falling  all around and swirling in an icy wind, cutting  2
1visibility down to a few yards.                                                                   2

3The blizzard has reached frightening proportions.Just visible through the snow is a large striped 2
1stick with "SOUTH POLE" written on it.                                                            2
2You are at the South Pole. I'm afraid you can    only go North.                                   2
3Of course you realise that the direction "North" is a little ambiguous when you are at the South  2
2Pole.  However I shall try to guess which way    you would like to go.                            2

1face to your north.                                                                               2
2The great rock rolls back to reveal a narrow     aperture just wide enough for a man.             2
3As you wave your rod, you get a strange          premonition - what you really need is a magic    2
1lamp.                                                                                             2
3P o p !!!   the genie appears.  "I know where we are" he says, "this is the cave of Elfi Bar-bar  2
1and his forty thieves."                                                                           2
3You have arrived in what appears to be the main  living accommodation for Elfi Bar-bar and his    2
3forty thieves.  Forty one sleeping bags are      arranged along one wall in two rather irregular  2
2rows, and the charred remains of a camp fire     are visible in one corner.                       2
1You are in Elfi Bar-bar's cave.                                                                   2
3In the east wall is a stout oak door.  The forty thieves have left a pile of old newspapers and   2
1their stock of fire-wood leaning up against it                                                    2
3Through the charred opening to the east, where   previously the door stood, the robber's treasure 2
1room is visible.                                                                                  2
3The flaming torch strikes the pile of newspaper  and dry wood, and the whole lot goes up in a     2
1sheet of flame, door and all.                                                                     2

3The train glides smoothly to a halt at the end ofthe line, and you are bundled out, among the     2
3throng of commuters, into an imposing terminus:  all victorian gothic and wrought iron. The crowd 2
1hurry off in all directions, leaving you alone...                                                 2
1You're on the station concourse.                                                                  2
3You are standing in the middle of the station    concourse. Above you is an ornate, illuminated   2
3sign reading 'welcome to Paranomasia (twinned    with Bracknell,Berks and Gomorrah,Wisconsin)'    2
3your trusty compass points to an imposing        portico, laden with stone cherubs and gilded     2
2hippogriffs. There are doorways to the left and  right.                                           2
1You're back in the lift lobby.                                                                    2
2You are in a small lobby. There, in front of you,are a set of elevator doors.                     2
1An elevator has arrived.                                                                          2
1You're on top of a gilded tower.                                                                  2
3You are atop a high, gilded tower, looking out   over an imposing city. The air is fresh and clean2
3and everywhere you look are flags, fluttering    bravely in the breeze.  In the distance, a dragon2
3circles in a thermal; although you can't be sure at such a distance, there may be someone on his  2
3back. Below you, the city stretches, its gilded  spires and minarettes catching the last rays of  2
3the setting sun. A faint scent of jasmine drifts on the evening breeze, mingled with the rich     2
1smells of spices and incense.......                                                               2

3You are on the steps of the railway station,     looking down on the market place of a great city.2
3Before you are spotless white buildings, tipped  with minarettes and corbels of pure gold, and    2
3elaborately bedecked with flags bearing the      crests of the great Paranomasiac families.  The  2
3sun is setting, and all around you, the stall    keepers are lighting their lanterns, forming     2
3glimmering pools of flickering light among the   throng. Nobody stares at you, as you stand,      2
3streaked with mud from the caves and festooned   with impedimenta: travellers are frequent and    2
1welcome in Paranomasia.........                                                                   2
1You're back at the stall of Marcus Spencius.                                                      2
3You are standing by the stall of Marcus Spencius,the merchant. The guttering flames of his lantern2
3illuminate his wares : worthless trinkets for thepleasure and delectation of the casual buyer, and2
2treasures of greater worth, for those with eyes  to see......                                     2

3Marcus saw you attempt to steal his merchandise. A bored-looking official elbows his way through  2

3You have arrived outside a stately pleasure dome.From inside drift strange and tantalising scents 2
3of sandalwood and myrrh. A damsel with a dulcimeris sitting outside, and the rippling music that  2
3she conjures brings thrills to your very soul.   The last rays of the setting sun turn the pillars2
1around the entrance into burnished flame.                                                         2
3A heavily armed steward bars your way "I regret,"he says, "that you cannot enter here". "Unless,  2
2of course, you are a member, and familiar with   the password......                               2
3An obsequious flunkey materialises out of the    woodwork : "since master is familiar with the    2
2password, I shall convey him to the realms of    pleasure. Please follow me.......                2
2The steward nods approvingly and ushers you      through the portals into the pleasure dome.....  2
1You're back in the travel office.                                                                 2
3You are in a small, but luxuriously furnished    office. A bearded man is sitting behind a desk,  2
3reading a copy of 'Gnomes and Gardens' and       looking rather bored. As you enter, he sighs and 2
3stands up. "If you want to get back to the caves,you can use my matter transporter, its just      2
2through that door to the south, but I hope you'vehad a good look round before you go."            2

3Littering the floor are jars of priceless oils   and unguents.                                    2
3Lurking in the corner, its vacant eye sockets    glaring at you for entering the domain of the    2
2undead, is the repulsive festering form of a     zombie!!!!!!                                     2
2A beautiful naked girl is standing submissively  before you.                                      2
1The zombie shuffles towards you, moaning         horribly.                                        2
2The zombie attempts to wrap its arms around you  but you brush it aside with a shudder.....       2
2The zombie stretches clammy hands towards your   face; you back away in disgust.........          2
3With a soul-wrenching cry, the zombie collapses  to the ground. Before your unbelieving eyes, it  2
3is briefly transformed into the naked body of a  beautiful young girl, before dissolving into a   2
3pile of ashes. All around you, the jars of oil   are dissolving too, until you are left alone,    2
1in a silent, empty room..........                                                                 2
3The alembic shatters on the floor before the     zombie, who crumples and falls to the ground,    2
3enveloped in green smoke. The smoke clears slowlyand there, on the floor, is the naked body of a  2
3beautiful young girl. She stands up gracefully   and turns towards you..... Out of the corner of  2
3your eye, you notice that the rest of the room isnow empty, save for a pile of silk cushions on   2
1floor............                                                                                 2

2The elevator climbs steadily. When it glides to  a halt, you find to your delight that            2
2The girl runs her hands sensuously through your  hair and kisses you passionately................ 2
2She beckons you towards the cushions on the floorwith an unmistakeable gleam in her eyes......... 2
2You sink down together on the silk cushions,     locked in a passionate embrace...................2
2Your eyes close as you thrill to her perfume, andwhen you open them                               2

3in full armour apparently awaiting some imminent conflict.  Curiously though, no one pays any     2

3out from the solid rock wall is a mediaeval      castle with lines of soldiers in full battle     2

3You have entered a room decorated in the austere japanese style. To the wailing of a samisen, a   2
3group of impassive geishas is performing the     tea ceremony. There is a scent of chrysanthemums 2
1in the air.                                                                                       2
2The geishas start back in fright at your coarse  western ways! relax, before you regret it!       2
2No. I said a scent of chrysanthemums. There      aren't any actually here.                        2
3The tea was fragrant and refreshing. As you drinkit, a geisha raises her eyes to yours and says   2
1" would master like to have a fugu ?"                                                             2
1"Then master would be advised to leave........"                                                   2
3As you are no doubt aware, the fugu is a fish,   considered a great delicacy in Japan, whose chief2
3attraction is that, unless it is very carefully  prepared, it is deadly poisonous. I'm afraid that2
2the chef was on leave today, and his assistant   isn't really clued up in such matters........... 2
1"Why not relax and have a cup of tea."%1                                                          2
2You have entered a room whose walls, floor and   ceiling are lined with ermine.                   2
1Lying on a low divan is a                                                                         2
2beautiful woman, naked but for a black ribbon    round her neck and a pair of black stockings.    2
1"Ooooooooh!.....More!!!......More!!!!........."                                                   2
1"Yes!!!!!!!!!       yes!!!!!!!!!!!"                                                               2
1"Aaaaaaaaaah!  you're wonderful!.........."                                                       2
1"Oh God!!  don't ever stop!!!!!!"                                                                 2
1"Oh well, dearie. That's it. Your time's up!!"                                                    2

1"Careful you don't ladder them!!"                                                                 2
1"You're a big boy now; you don't need any help!"                                                  2
3The room you have just entered is similar in     appearance to a mediaeval torture chamber. Around2
2the walls are fibreglass replicas of fiendish    appliances like thumbscrews and iron maidens.    2
1Glowering truculently at you is a                                                                 2
2woman dressed entirely in leather, and carrying  a riding crop.                                   2
2"Personally I'd get the hell out of here! I neverdid go for that sort of thing!"%1                2
2" I really wouldn't go anywhere near her, if I   were you. She could be dangerous."%1             2
1What do you want that for, or shouldn't I ask?                                                    2
1Oh! pardon me for living, I'm sure!!                                                              2
1"No need!.....I'm yours!!!........"                                                               2
2I think she can defend herself adequately, so I  wouldn't recommend any rough stuff.              2
1People are looking at you both, and sniggering.                                                   2
2While your back was turned, she clouted you with the riding crop. I hope you didn't enjoy it!     2
2"You're no fun! I'm going off to find that nice  insurance salesman!"                             2

3You have entered a concert hall full of people inevening dress. On the stage, a counter-tenor,    2

3You are on the east bank of a little brook which chatters and gurgles merrily as the water        2
3cascades over the pebbles beneath the surface.   Little fish dart back and forth here and there   2
3and the sunshine glints and twinkles as it       dances over the water's surface.                 2
2  The warm sunshine is pleasantly soporific, and the grass is soft, lush and green.               2
1You are on the east bank of the babbling brook.                                                   2
3Unfortunately the cute little fish darting back  and forth under the surface are in actual fact   2
3pirhanas.  You have managed to scramble back ontothe bank, but not before both your legs have been2
1consumed.                                                                                         2
1I'm afraid you have no option at the moment.                                                      2
2I'm afraid you can't go anywhere without any     legs.                                            2
2The pain from your mutilated legs is much too    severe for you to contemplate sleeping.          2
3Correct !  Nice to know that you weren't defeatedby being de-feeted !  A stabbing pain is felt in 2
3the stumps of your legs as they slowly elongate  into two brand new and perfectly formed legs.    2
2Even your trousers are restored. (After all we   don't want to get arrested now do we ?)          2
3The dizzy warmth of the summer's afternoon closesin on you and the smell of the grass makes your  2
1senses reel as you drift off into a deep sleep.                                                   2
2You awake very much refreshed and ready to face  anything that fate has to throw at you.          2
3Suddenly your slumbers are disturbed by a figure rushing noisily past.  Through your blinking eyes2
3you can just make out the figure of a white      rabbit as he pauses to consult his pocket watch. 2
2 "Oh I'm late" he says, "I'm most terribly late."Before scurrying off.                            2
3The chase takes you breathlessly over several    hedges and small brooks then finally into a large2
3grassy field.  You arrive just in time to see therabbit, now only a few yards ahead, vanish down a2
1rabbit hole.                                                                                      2

3You are falling down a seemingly bottomless pit. As you hurtle downwards, you can just make out   2
2that the walls seem to be lined with neat rows   of shelves.                                      2
1By what agency do you intend to achieve that ?                                                    2

3An interesting philosophical question.  Maybe, onthe other hand, bats eat cats? before you have   2
3time to work it all out however, your thoughts   are rudely interrupted as you land in a heap on  2
1the floor (I've no idea who left it there).                                                       2

3Suddenly your fall is checked as you land in a   heap on the floor (I've no idea who left it      2
1there).                                                                                           2
2The grass is getting sparser now, and a cold windis getting up.                                   2
1Sorry - sleep walking is too dangerous.                                                           2
2This is no time to be worrying about what you arecarrying - you've got no legs!                   2
3If you really want the custodian to step in and  help you, type the magic words "prog zarp" and he2
3will restore your legs (at a price).  With       suitable magic though, you might be able to get  2
1them back for free.                                                                               2
3With an enormous bang, your legs are restored to their former glory.  You have been penalised     2
2though for coming cap in hand to the custodians  for help.                                        2
3As you proceed north, you begin to become more   enclosed.  Two large cliffs have risen up to east2
2and west and seem to be getting closer the       further you go.                                  2
3You are in a narrow valley running from north to south.  Two high and sheer cliff walls enclose   2
2you to the east and west, and the sound of your  footsteps echoes eerily between the two cliffs.  2
3After a short distance, the cliffs move closer   still until you can actually touch both walls    2
2simultaneously with your hands.  A few yards     further and the two cliffs actually join.        2
3You are standing in the "v" shape formed by two  enormous cliffs.  There is a small aperture to   2
2the north where they join, but it is scarcely    big enough to admit a human hand.                2
3The light from the sky is suddenly extinguished. Several pink and green flashes are visible but   2
3they seem as if they could be coming from inside your own head.  An incredible feeling of vertigo 2
3and nausea overtakes you as you become completelydisoriented and collapse onto the ground.        2
3  Minutes if not hours pass before your senses   finally return.  When you pick yourself up and   2
3look around, you are in complete darkness except for a small chink of light to the south.  On     2
3looking through this aperture you can see open   air the other side of it.  Your wand lies the    2
2other side of the crack, tantalisingly out of    reach.                                           2
3As you move southwards, the cliffs recede into   the distance, and a small brook approaches from  2
1your right hand side.                                                                             2
1You are at the joining of the cliff walls.                                                        2
2You are on a cold and windy plain.  Grass is     growing here and there, but only in small clumps.2
3As you proceed southwards, it starts to snow.    There is no grass underfoot anymore, and the wind2
1is getting worse.                                                                                 2
3As you proceed northwards, the wind starts to    drop a little.  It has stopped snowing and there 2
1is even the odd clump of grass underfoot.                                                         2
2You are in a large field with a hedge all around it, and a rabbit hole in one corner.             2
2You are in a small square room with a door in    each wall.                                       2
1You are in the four doored room.                                                                  2

2You are in total darkness except for a small     crack of light to the south.                     2
42340123622361    2                              ESCAPE THROUGH CRACK                              6
2As you scramble through, the crack mysteriously  closes up behind you.                            2
2The crack is barely large enough for your hand,  you can't hope to crawl through it.              2
3You are in a small draughty cave.  A passage     leads off to the west, and the cave is           2
2illuminated by bright sunlight pouring in througha large hole in the south wall.                  2
2As if by magic, the crack grows until it is abouttwo feet across.                                 2
1shrouded in an impenetrable gloom.                                                                2
3You are in a small but comfortably furnished     room, the walls of which are lined from floor to 2
3ceiling with neat rows of leather bound volumes. The sole exception being the east wall which     2
3contains the only door, and a large portrait of  a genial looking old wizard.  The tomes which    2
3line the walls are very dusty, which makes one   wonder if any have been read for several years.  2
3The green leather chairs are in contrast         spotless, and the dark wooden tables placed here 2
2and there boast a shine that only daily polishingcould maintain.                                  2
1You are in the library.                                                                           2
3The most peculiar feature of the room must surelybe however the centre section of the north wall. 2
2At this point the bookcase has swung forward to  reveal a secret passageway.                      2
3As you try to withdraw the book, you realise thatit is actually a cunningly disguised lever.  As  2
3you pull it towards you, there is a loud grating noise as a whole section of the north wall book- 2
1case starts to move...                                                                            2
1There are no books on the east wall.                                                              2
3The volume you have chosen is written in a       strange and rare dialect of elvish, and is thus  2
1totally incomprehensible.                                                                         2
2You have chosen a French English phrase book -   not very entertaining I'm afraid.                2
1From which wall ?                                                                                 2
1Please answer north, south, east or west.                                                         2
3You appear to have arrived (via the wardrobe     door !) into someone's bedroom.  On closer       2
1examination of you surroundings, it appears that                                                  2
3You are in a ladies boudoir.  The occupant is    (unfortunately) not present, but discarded items 2
3of clothing scattered here and there tend to     indicate that she is in the habit of dressing in 2
3the manner of a byegone age (and in rather a     hurry !).  There are no windows, but the light   2
3from a small gas lamp reveals a small bed againstthe north wall, and a wardrobe against the west  2
1wall.  The main door is to the east.                                                              2
1You are now in the wardrobe.                                                                      2
3You are on the landing overlooking what looks    like a saloon bar plucked stright from the days  2
3of the wild west.  A flight of wooden steps leadsdown into the bar area where all manner of rough 2
3cowboy types are laughing, drinking and talking. The only other exit from the landing appears to  2
1be a small door to the west.                                                                      2
2Behind the bar there is a flight of wooden stairsleading up to the first floor landing.           2
1You are on the landing again.                                                                     2
3Suddenly th back wall of the wardrobe swings openand the floor tips, ejecting you unceremoniously 2
1through the aperture.                                                                             2
3You are in semi darkness.  The small amount of   light coming from an opening to the west reveals 2
2that to your north is a small wooden door in the rock face beside which is a life sized painting  2
1of an elf wielding an axe.                                                                        2
1of an elf.                                                                                        2
3For a moment, the elf and the axe take on an     almost lifelike quality.  You can hardly believe 2
3your eyes when the elf drops his axe on the floorwith a clang before once more becoming a mere    2
1painting.                                                                                         2
2You are in semi darkness.  You can just make out however a solid wall to the east.                2
3You are on a very narrow ledge on the east face  of an enormous rock wall.  The cold rock face    2
3is totally unclimable above you, but there seem  to be a few footholds here and there below.  The 2
3way down looks very long and perilous however,   and the bottom is out of sight, hidden by the    2
2cold mist that pervades the vast open chamber to the east.                                        2
3  The ledge itself continues unbroken northwards as far as the eye can see.  To the south, the    2
3ledge terminates abruptly at a small wooden door in the rock face that marks the southern end of  2
1the vast chamber.                                                                                 2
3As you emerge through the door,  the contrast is breathtaking.  A moment ago you were in a small  2
3warm but cramped room.  Suddenly now however,    the ceiling and right hand wall are no more, and 2
1the air is cold and crisp like a winter's night.                                                  2
3The ledge continues and the scenery remains much as before - rugged, vast and breathtaking.  A    2
3vast torrent of water is cascading down from     somewhere high up in the roof and thundering down2
3into the abyss below.  Over the eons, the spray  has etched a small alcove in the rock face to    2
3your west.  The ledge however must be of harder  rock because it continues both north and         2
3southwards as far as the eye can see.  The spray from the waterfall keeps the rock continually    2
2dampened making it slippery and thus unclimable  both above and below.                            2
3The ledge itself continues southwards as far as  the eye can see.  To the north however it        2
2vanishes through a low archway in the wall that  marks the northern end of this vast open chamber.2
2You are on a narrow ledge on the face of the     enormous cliff wall opposite a waterfall.        2
3In the small alcove, the noise of the waterfall  slightly less deafening, but it is still very    2
1cold and damp, and the floor is wet.                                                              2

2seven foot long solid oak plank with one rather  chewed up end.                                   2
2You are at the south end of the narrow ledge on  the cliff wall.                                  2

3You are at the foot of a flight of very crumbly  stairs leading upwards.  The stairs look         2
3extremely unsafe - there are great holes here andthere where the cement has given way, and every  2
2now and then, another lump gives way and crashes into the depths below.                           2
1You are at the foot of the crumbly stairs.                                                        2
2Fortunately however, the solid oak plank laid    across them provides a safe walkway.             2
3As you step out onto the stairway, it collapses  with a great crash, depositing you into the      2
1chamber below.                                                                                    2
3You are at the head of a flight of very crumbly  stairs which look as if they could collapse      2

3You have arrived at the joining of three tunnels which stretch out to the south, east and west.   2
3The north wall is made of a crumbly yellow rock, and the floor is covered with yellow dust.  A    2
1strong smell of sulphur pervades the air.                                                         2

3The eastern gallery turns out to be a dead end.  The sulphur is about half an inch thick on the   2
1floor here, and the smell is quite overpowering.                                                  2
3You are in an extremely narrow and not very high passage.  The passage which enters from the east 2
1turns sharply north at this point.                                                                2

3You are on the north side of a large, warm and   brilliantly lit chamber.  There is a small door  2
2in the north wall which bears in ancient gold    painted letters the mystic word "borador".       2
3You are on the south side of a large, warm and   brilliantly lit room.  There is a small opening  2
2in the south wall at this point, and a passage   leading off to the south.                        2
3The source of light however is a large cubicle   made out of crystal clear glass in the centre of 2
3the chamber.  Stretching from floor to ceiling,  this cubicle is almost unbearably bright to look 2
3at, lit by cunningly hidden fluorescent tubes.   In the centre of the cubicle there is a small    2
3wooden table on which is placed a glittering     elvic crown made of solid platinum and embedded  2
1with all manner of precious stones.                                                               2

2The glass is strongly re-inforced and thus       completely unbreakable.                          2
1There is no way into the cubicle.                                                                 2

2You are in a very small inspection chamber.      Looking down through the hole in the floor, you  2
2can see the glass cubicle containing the elvic   crown below you.                                 2

3You are in a glass cubicle lit by an almost      intolerable glare from concealed fluorescent     2
1lights.  Nearby there is a small wooden table                                                     2

2The crown is attached by some invisible security system to the table.                             2
1The table is firmly fixed to the floor.                                                           2
3The lights dim, and there is a faint click from  somewhere in the vicinity of the table.  Slowly  2
2the north and south walls of the cubicle start   to grind inwards with a hollow grating noise.    2
1Please type "end" again.                                                                          2
1The walls continue to move in.                                                                    2
1The walls are closer still.                                                                       2
1This is no time to worry about what you are      carrying.                                        2
3The walls are about 1 foot apart and begining to press in on you (the table has mysteriously      2
2vanished).  I should say this is about your last chance to reverse this terrible spell.           2
1Too late !  The walls have crushed you to a pulp                                                  2
2Suddenly a trap door opens in the floor, and you drop rather ungracefully downwards.              2

3You are in some sort of under-floor storage      room.  The remains of some cardboard boxes which 2
3apparently once contained some sort of biscuits  are piled up against the north wall, but rats    2
3have long since eaten the contents.  The rats    however were obviously still hungry, because they2
2also seem to have eaten a significant portion of the east wall.                                   2
1You are in the under floor store room.                                                            2
3You are in an extremely dirty and dark tunnel.   Every little now and then you catch sight of a   2
3pair of little pink eyes through the semi-gloom, before its owner scurries of squeeking loudly    2
3into the shadows.  The tunnel runs from east to  west, but there is a fair sized crack in the     2
1south wall.                                                                                       2
2You are in the tunnel of rats, and there is a    crack in the south wall.                         2
3Through this aperture you can just make out a    number of figures dressed in blue uniforms.      2
3They seem to have formed some sort of road block and are standing behind a large sign marked:%1   2
3 "official elvic police road block.%1              The elvic crown has been stolen - please%1     2
2  co-operate with police to secure arrest of%1     culprits."%1                                   2
3As you arrive at the road block, the police stop and search you.  On finding nothing of interest  2
1however, they let you pass.                                                                       2
3On arrival at the road block, the police stop youand search you.  There is a great deal of        2
3uproar when the elvic crown is found about your  person, and it is confiscated, and you are       2
1whisked off in a police car, sirens blaring.                                                      2
3You are in darkness again.  Only a faint green   glow from the east reveals that there is a door  2
2to the south.  There is also a rather unpleasant smell coming from a vaguely northerly direction. 2
2The door slams shut behind you, as if of its own volition.                                        2
3You are in a small box room.  There is a stout   wooden door to the north, and a dusty passage    2
1leading off to the east.                                                                          2
1You are in the box room.                                                                          2
3It is quite a long crawl.  On several occaions   it looks as if the passage is going to get too   2
3low or too narrow to permit further progress, butsomehow you manage to wriggle through.  Finally  2
1you emerge into somewhat less cramped conditions.                                                 2
3You are in a vast underground chamber.  The chasmis so tall, that clouds are visible high up above2
3you.  You seem to be in the south west corner of this chamber, but any progress north is          2
3impossible, because a torrent of water from      somewhere way up above you is thundering down    2
3to crash into a turbulent underground lake to    your north.  There is however a small opening in 2
2the east wall, and the wall itself looks as if   it may be climbable.                             2
2You are in the south east corner of the giant    chamber.                                         2
3You are in the south east corner of the vast     chamber.  Progress north is still impossible     2
2due to the enormous waterfall,  and the west wallat which you have arrived is totally unscalable. 2
2You are in the south west corner of the vast     chamber.                                         2
3I wouldn't advise any attempt to progress north, you would surely perish under the thunderous     2
1might of that waterfall.                                                                          2
3You have arrived in a small room which seems to  have a choice of three exits.  The south wall    2
3contains a small archway through which a bright  green glow is shining.  The floor of this        2
3southern passage seems to be covered with molten metal, but strangely no heat can be felt.  To the2
3east, there is a ragged crack in the wall, whilstto the north, there is another passage leading   2
1off.                                                                                              2
3You are in the small room with exits of some     sort or another leading off to west, south and   2
1north.                                                                                            2
3The northern exit however is guarded by a most   fearsome brute.  A large two headed dog, both    2
2heads growling fiercely is standing in the       opening.                                         2
3The axe describes a graceful arc, and neatly     slices off both heads from the guardian of the   2
1north passage.                                                                                    2
2The two headed dog bars your way with an even    fiercer growl.                                   2
2The passage continues north a little way before  turning to the east.                             2
3You are on the east side of an eight foot round  pool of boiling oil.  The passage obviously      2
3continues the other side, but it is too far to   jump as there is not much of a ledge the other   2
1side.                                                                                             2
3As you step into the green glow, the elvic crown melts in your hand without so much as a single   2
1degree raised in temperature.                                                                     2
3You are in a small l-shaped room lit by a bright green glow from above.  There is a pool of cool  2
2but molten metal on the floor.  Passages lead    off to north and west.                           2

2The custodian vetoes that move - you would       perish in the boiling oil.                       2
2The passage continues east for a while, then     turns sharply south.                             2

3You are on the west side of a pool of boiling    oil.  The pool is about eight feet across, and   2

3giant waterfall is thundering from somewhere     high in the roof, down into the depths far below 2
3there seem to be no hand or foot holds above or  below you, so climbing in either direction is    2
3impossible.  The cavern is however narrower at   this point than any other, and a similar ledge   2
3on the west wall is only a tantalising twenty    feet or so away.  Just a little bit too far to   2

3circle to elf king Dronwed, eighth of the Llewyd dynasty, in thanks to the king when the latter   2
3saved the wizard's fair daughter Brathnia from   the clutches of the zorks.  The crown was said   2
3to possess many magic qualities, and protect its wearer from all manner of evils.  Moreover when  2
3king Dronwed died in the 49th winter of the      rain era, it was reported that his soul had been 2
3transported to the crown, and that the crown was therefore possessed of its own free will and thus2
3has the power to resist any attempt to remove it from the inner sanctum.                          2
3 However,to encourage the spirit of the true     adventurer, the wizard Idris declared (apparently2
3with the late Dronwed's approval) that there     would be one path left to allow a true           2
1      (type 'more' for continuation)                                                              2
3Adventuring spirit to take the crown for his own,provided only that he agree to cherish the memory2
3of king Dronwed.                                   The crown therefore has the power not only to  2
3hinder, but also to assist your departure from   this place.  In its presence, even once familiar 2
1places will be seen to have changed.                                                              2

3As you try to step out onto the stairway, your   foot strikes an invisible force field which      2

3You are in what appears to be an Edwardian games room. Around the walls are pictures of racehorses2
3and prizefighters, and in one corner are four    chairs, surrounding a green baize card table. on 2
3the table are a pair of ivory dice and an        enameled snuff box, decorated with pictures of   2
2spiders. Behind a green baize curtain is a door  marked 'EXIT'.                                   2
1Glittering on the dusty ground is a                                                               2
2You may play with the dice, if you wish, but I amnot allowed to let you take them away.           2
1Lying unobtrusively on the ground is a                                                            2
3The box appears to be stuck to the table. As you may be aware, the Earl of Sandwich was notorious 2
1for his careless attitude to chewing gum!                                                         2
1Water may be found: North from Paranomasia, in   the jungle or north from the underground stream. 2
1Ah, come on!                                                                                      2
1Lying on the ground, for all to see, is a                                                         2
1six and one.                                                                                      2
1Six and one again. They're probably loaded!                                                       2
2Inside the box is a beautiful gold brooch, in theshape of a spider.                               2
1The box is already open.                                                                          2
1beautiful gold brooch in the shape of a spider.                                                   2
3Out of the corner of your eye, you catch a flash of gold, but too late : your gold spider has been2
3transformed into a real one - a tarantula which  leaps on your neck and injects its venom into    2
1your jugular vein.                                                                                2
3As you open the door, it's snatched from your    hands and you are overwhelmed by a flood of      2
3custard. It finally stabilises at about six feet deep, but more is gushing from a pipe in the     2
3ceiling. Great avalanches of cherries and sponge cakes are raining dowen on your head, as you     2
1float there, treading custard                                                                     2
1Don't concern yourself with trifles!!                                                             2
3The exit door bursts with the pressure, and you  are washed out into the street. You narrowly     2
2avoid being licked to death by a pack of girl    guides.                                          2
2I wouldn't go near it. The occupants might come  back.                                            2
3You are in a rather tawdry room. In one corner isan unmade bed, showing signs of recent use; next 2
2to it is a chair, over which is draped a pair of trousers. I think someone left in a hurry!!      2
1They're not your size. Leave them alone!                                                          2
1Try searching the pockets.                                                                   031622
2In one pocket, you find a yellowing parchment.   In the other, a small lump of green putty.       2
1The pockets are empty.                                                                       031622

3The trousers have turned into gold lame. Quite   fetching, but I don't think the owner will be    2
1very pleased!                                                                                     2
3All the fillings in your teeth have turned to    gold! Just be careful that it isn't the iron in  2
2your blood next time. Perhaps you'd better returnit to its owner, if you can find him.            2
2The Philosophers' Stone falls to the ground and  vanishes!!!!                                     2
3An old and slightly embarassed-looking alchemist appears, wearing a long cloak covered with       2
3cabalistic symbols, a high pointed hat and a     pair of gold lame trousers. He speaks " Thank    2
3you for finding my precious stone. I must have   left it in the - er - library. As a token of my  2
3appreciation, I shall tell you of a magic word   which may save you in time of trouble. Don't     2
2use it more than once, though. The word is       BEZANTS".                                        2
2You are instantly surrounded by a wall of flame. When it subsides, your surroundings have changed:2
3You are instantly surrounded by a wall of flame  which consumes you completely, right down to your2
2socks! The last thing you hear is an ancient     voice intoning "...and BEZANTS to you, too..."   2
3Well, I did warn you. All the iron in your blood has turned to gold. I'm afraid the human kidneys 2
3don't react too favourably to that sort of       treatment. You've gone a very interesting colour 2
1though!! %0                                                                                       2
3The room you have entered is redolent with the   scent of flowers and something else less easy to 2
3identify.  All round the walls are pots of       flowers of every hue and fragrance.  In the midst2
2of these flowers is a white wooden box, in the   shape somewhat reminiscent of an eastern pagoda. 2
1Please leave the flowers alone.                                                                   2
3Why did you take the lid off the beehive?????    You've released a swarm of bees. Be very careful:2
1their bites could be fatal!                                                                       2
1Too late for that! Let's get out of here!                                                         2
1Leave it alone, let's scram.                                                                      2
1One of the bees just stung you! Ouch!                                                             2
1Buzzing angrily in the air above your head is a                                                   2
1swarm of bees.                                                                                    2
2SPLASH!!!!  You're in.  You emerge, dripping wet,but the bees have gone..                         2
1You're just making them more annoyed! RUN!!!                                                      2
1Try heading for water!!                                                                           2
2There's no point in getting wet unless you have  to.                                              2
3You have entered an almost featureless room. The walls and ceiling are a uniform grey and seem to 2
3be in some way insubstantial, like cobwebs. The  door through which you have entered is no longer 2
3visible: the only exit is a perfectly round hole in the floor. In the exact centre of the room is 2
2a marble pillar, about the height of a man...                                                     2
1The pillar is quite definitely immovable.                                                         2
2You slide down a steel tube and emerge, blinking,into the sunlight.                               2
3The room you have entered reminds you, in a      curious way, of a waxworks. All around the walls 2
3are fully inflated, inflatable women. Whoever    made these figures really knew his business :    2
3they are uncannily lifelike. Unfortunately, his  choice of model has lessened the erotic impact,  2
2somewhat. There, standing before you, are 100    clones of Margaret Thatcher!!!                   2
1My sentiments, entirely!!!!!                                                                      2
1Sorry to disappoint you, but it's only a doll!                                                    2
1box labelled "Kate Bush Doll (Self-inflating)"                                                    2
1Not here. Wait till you get home!                                                                 2
3As you enter the crowded station, the handle of  someone's umbrella catches on a ring on the      2
3outside of the "Inflatable Woman" box. (What do  you mean, you hadn't noticed?). With a           2
3deliciously flatulent noise, the model inflates  to its full size. Have you ever been in a        2
2crowded railway station with a naked woman under one arm ?  Well, you have, now!!                 2
1The valve appears to be jammed.                                                                   2
1What with?                                                                                        2
1Your way is blocked by a sea of jeering faces.                                                    2
3As you let go, the doll is caught by a freak gustof wind and sails off into the sky, never to be  2
1seen again. Oh well, better luck next time!                                                       2
2You are surrounded by a jeering crowd who are    making somewhat unsavoury allegations.           2

3You are on a path that has been well trodden     down through regular use by some fairly large and2
3heavy animals.  The path runs from north to      south, and on either side, thick bands of        2
1delicate ferns sway gently in the warm breeze.                                                    2
3Unfortunately, the picturesque fronds are coveredwith hundreds and hundreds of microscopic        2
2stinging cells, and you stagger back with a      painful rash forming all over your arms and legs.2
3The ground underfoot is soft and rather marshy   here.  The surrounding bushes are covered with   2
3tiny droplets of water which glisten brightly in the fierce sunlight.  Here and there, large muddy2
3puddles have formed, and as you walk, your feet  make unpleasant squelching noises as the mud is  2
1forced up and over your shoes.                                                                    2
3You seem to have wandered into the marshes.  The heat is intense and the humidity oppressive.     2
3Visibility is down to about five yards because ofthe thick steamy mist that pervades the entire   2
3area.  The soft sticky mud which covers the      ground seems to vary in depth, but for the most  2
2part it seems to come up to your knees, making   progress slow and tiring.                        2
1The mud seems to get worse to the east.                                                           2
1The mud seems to get worse to the south.                                                          2
1The mud seems to get worse to the north.                                                          2
1You are wandering in the marshes.                                                                 2
3Suddenly the whole scene darkens and the heavens open.  You have been caught in one of those      2
3sudden tropical rainstorms.  In a matter of      seconds you are soaked to the skin, and with the 2
3pounding of the deluge on your head driving away all sense of reason, you run in blind panic (and 2
3in who knows what direction ? ) seeking shelter. At last you find it, and you sit, panting, in the2
3darkness and gathering your thoughts.  Then, justas suddenly as it started, the pounding of the   2
2rain stops and the sky lightens, enabling you to take stock of your surroundings.%1 %0            2
3You are in a small cave, illuminated by bright   sunlight pouring in through the entrance to the  2
3west.  Here and there on the floor there are     neat little piles of well picked and gnawed      2
3bones, and in one corner is a pile of large greenspeckled eggs.  Obviously there is something out 2
2there in the jungle that looks upon this cave as home ! %0                                        2
3As you gather up the bones, you are suddenly     interrupted by a nerve shattering roar.  You turn2
2to discover (to your horror) that the            owner/occupier of the cave has returned.         2
3The creature in question would be describable as slightly resembling a mouse were it not for the  2
3fact that it is about fifteen feet from the floorto the tips of its ears!  Behind it, twenty feet 2
3of hefty tail swish angrily back and forth.      Its mouth opens to reveal two parallel rows of   2
3sharp teeth lining each jaw, and the fearsome    growl that emerges tells you that                2
2it had considered the bones to be its supper,    but now it has other plans.....                  2
3The great jaws open once more, but what emerges  this time is not a roar, but a long snake like   2
3tongue which flicks out like a whiplash and      curles round you, dragging you screaming into    2
1that merciless mouth.                                                                             2
3The sharp teeth, each the size of a pickaxe, slamtogether, and after a brief moment of agony -    2
1blissful oblivion.                                                                                2
3With a loud gulp, the creature swallows you wholeand you slide unceremoniously down that chimney  2
2like oesophagus to land with a splash in the     waiting gastric juices.                          2
3Suddenly you are interrupted by a nerve          shattering roar.  you turn to find (to your      2
2horror) that the owner/occupier of the cave has  returned.                                        2
3You are floating in the caustic juices inside    the stomach of the giant creature.  The stinging 2
3feeling all over you body tells you that,        unless you get out of here fast, you too will    2
3soon be nothing more than one of those semi      digested and unrecognisable lumps of meat that   2
1can be seen bobbing about here and there.                                                         2
3Well - that seems to have had a rather startling effect.  The creature has started to retch, the  2
3gastric juices swelling like a stormy ocean with each convulsion.  A moment later, you are hurtled2
3out through that terrible mouth as the creature  is violently sick.  Obviously however, the       2
3creature has no intention of letting you get     away that easily, and it starts to lumber towards2
1you again menacingly.                                                                             2
3I'm afraid those gastric juices are starting to  get you.  Slowly you can fell your senses        2
1slipping....                                                                                      2
3You are at the edge of the jungle.  The ground   underfoot is soft and very wet, and seems to get 2
3worse to the west.  A thin band of open ground   runs from north to south, whilst to your east    2
2is a tall cliff in which the mouth of a small    cave is visible.                                 2
3For several minutes you flee in fear for your    life, neither noticing nor caring which direction2
2you go in.  Finally you stop and fall to the     floor, panting and exhausted.                    2
3As you pick up the first egg, it starts to crack open and, to your amazement, a mouse-like        2
1creature the size of an alsatian emerges.                                                         2
3Obviously these creatures are carnivorous from   birth, because with a mind blowing squeal, the   2
3baby launches itself at you, sinking its         double rows of knife like teeth deep into your   2
1flesh.                                                                                            2
2The baby gives a squeak of fear before running   out of the cave in fright.                       2
2The ground here is damp and marshy, and the      humidity oppressive.                             2
3You are at the edge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground running from north to south.2
1A vast cliff face rises to your east.                                                             2
3After a few feet, one of the scanty foot holds   collapses under your weight, and you are         2
1deposited on the ground amid a pile of debris.                                                    2
3I'm afraid you missed your footing and fell.  At the foot of the cliff, your head strikes a large 2
1rock, and it is all over.                                                                         2
2You are clinging by your toes and finger tips to a vast rock wall.                                2
2You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face which rises sheer to the north and east.    2

3You are at the edge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground that continues southwards.  2
3To the west there is a vast cliff face, through  a hole in which the wide and fast flowing river  2
1(which is to the north of you) vanishes.                                                          2
3You are wading up to your waist in a wide and    fast flowing river.  Here and there, log like    2
1objects can be seen floating in the warm waters.                                                  2

1particularly bright and lush.                                                                     2
3Your attention is particularly drawn to a large  bush which supports a single bloom of flame red. 2
2The flower is about ten inches across and sways  gently in the breeze.                            2
3For a moment you hold the exotic flower in your  hand, then suddenly it wilts and turns to dust   2
1in front of your very eyes.                                                                       2
3The smell of the flower is actually a powerful   narcotic.  You are instantly shot onto a higher  2
3plane of awareness as violently swirling pink    and green patterns can be seen circling before   2
1your eyes.                                                                                        2
3The scent of this flower is most pleasant, but   also a powerful narcotic.  For several minutes   2
2your blood races as you feel you are flying      through the air like a bird.                     2
3The delicate perfume of the flower has a strong  narcotic effect, and you suddenly perceive all   2
2manner of strange and terrifying creatures       running from bush to bush.                       2
3The smell of the flower is a powerful drug.  For a moment you feel as if your head is growing like2
2some vast balloon, then finally it blows your    mind completely.                                 2

2The beautiful bird spreads its wings and takes   flight.                                          2
2For a moment, the bird seems somewhat interested in your bird seed, then it panics and flies off. 2
2The bird swallows the entire packet of seed in   one almighty gulp, then it flies away.           2
3The bird seed in your hand holds the birds       attention for long enough for you to deliver it  2

3The jungle opens out a little bit here, and      there are several tall trees dotted about.  Long 2

3There is a violent flash, and for a moment the   pink troll turns puce before melting away before 2
3your eyes into a strangely coloured liquid.  The liquid begins to boil, and evaporates leaving a  2

3You seem to have upset the troll by waving that  thing in its face.  With a fearce growl, it grabs2
1your rod, and crunches it up in a trice.                                                          2

3Inside the crater, and way down below you,       stretches a vast jungle - as far as the eye can  2
3see.  In the other direction however, there is   a cold impenetrable blackness.  It is as if you  2
2are standing on the very edge of existance       itself.                                          2

3Just think for a moment.  How do you open a      locked door (without damaging it) when you do'nt 2
1have the correct key ?                                                                            2
2You now find yourself in a little clearing in thejungle.                                          2
3In front of you there is a most curioius machine.Shaped not unlike a motor cycle, with saddle and 2
3a dashboard (complete with several dials and a   large white lever) it is a most delicate and     2
3intricate apparatus.  There is ivory in it, and  some transparent crystalline substance.  It looks2
3to be singularly askew, and it contains several  bars, one of which has an odd twinkling          2
1appearance, making it seem somehow unreal.                                                        2
3You seem to reel, and get a nightmare sensation  of falling.  It passes quickly however, and when 2
3you recover, you look up to see that the clouds  are moving across the sky at terrific speed as   2
3if in some freak wind.  The path of the sun      across the heavens is also being executed at     2
3great speed which is constantly increasing, untilit becomes just a blurred streak.  Suddenly it   2
3is night - then just as suddenly, the following  day.  Night follows day follows night in an      2
3ever faster blur, until the flickering becomes   too fast to percieve.  All around you, trees are 2
3growing from seedlings to giant forests in the   twinkling of an eye, and most other motion       2
2proceeds too quickly for you to percieve, whilst the dials on the dashboard spin at great speed.  2
3You cling grimly to the saddle and watch in      amazement as you are flung headlong through time 2
1itself.                                                                                           2
3For a moment your head reels and you feel as if  you are falling, but the experience is           2
3transitory.  Looking up you see that the sun has begun to move across the heavens at noticeable   2
3speed travelling from west to east, and that it  is moving faster by the moment.  The dials in    2
3front of you are spinning round clockwise, and   moments later, it is night.  Then, just as       2
3suddenly, it is day again, then night, and so on in ever faster succession until they become a    2
3mere flickering before ceasing to be perceivable.All around you, vast forest shrink back into the 2
3ground, before new trees leap in an instant to   take their place.  All other motion in the       2
2outside world flashes past so quickly that you   can not see it.                                  2
3The machine seems to lurch violently, and you areflung headlong from it to land head over heels on2
2to the ground.  Still dazed, you stagger to your feet, and start to look around.                  2
3The machine is still there beside you, but the   jungle seems to have taken on a strangely        2
3prehistoric air.  A screech from above makes you look up.  High above you, a pair of pterodactyls 2
3can be seen circling in the sky.  Then a great   roar brings your eyes back to earth. %1          2
3  Approaching you from the nearby trees at great haste is a living specimen of tyranosaurus rex - 2
1saliva dripping from its great jaws.                                                              2
3You leap onto the saddle, but the monster is     still there - nearly upon you, its great jaws are2
1opening ready to devour you !                                                                     2
3Too late !  T. Rex is upon you.  You have time   only to think "Mark Bolan all is forgiven",      2
2before you become just another snack between     meals.                                           2
3You are seated comfortably on the saddle.  In    front of you are several dials, and a large white2
2lever which is unmarked, but looks as if it couldmove in either direction.                        2
1The lever is over as far as it will go.                                                           2
3Your journey through time continues - then       suddenly you realise (too late) that you have    2
2shot back to a time before the earth existed.    That of course means there is no atmosphere..... 2
3Your journey through time continues, but slowly  the flickering returns and you realise that the  2
3rotation of the earth is slowing down.           Eventually the sun comes to rest, just a few     2
3degrees above the horizon.  Then suddenly - the  ageing star swells to a super nova - the earth   2
2and you along with it are instantaneously        consumed in an explosion of cosmic proportions.  2
3You realise of course that dismounting from a    moving time machine is a bit like jumping down   2
3off an Inter-city 125 in full flight.  Your      molecules hit the waiting universe at a speed    2
2of about 42 years per hypersecond and are dashed to smithereens.                                  2
3You are on a soft, newly mown lawn, edged with   rhododendron bushes.  Two buildings are visible. 2
3To the east there is a huge building with        intricate parapets and tall columns, and a large 2
3open portal that yawns shodowy and mysterioius.  To the south is a veritable palace built         2
3apparently of green porcelain. %1                  You can also see, to the north and slightly    2
2west, a large white sphinx set upon a pedistal   the size of a house.                             2
3You are on the lawn roughly equidistant from the sphinx, the palace of green porcelain, and the   2
1large building with yawning portal.                                                               2
1Your time machine is standing right beside you.                                                   2
3Of your time machine however, there is no trace. Instead, there is a deep furrow running across   2
2the grass, and vanishing under the great bronze  doors in the plinth beneath the white sphinx.    2
2You have arrived just to the east of the great   white sphinx.                                    2
2In the pedistal are two great bronze doors,      firmly shut.                                     2
2The great bronze doors however are mysteriously  open, as if someone is almost inviting you in.   2
2I'm afraid that way would take you into the      rhododendrons.                                   2
3You are now in the palace of green porcelain.    It appears to be some sort of museum, full of    2
3all manner of machines and artifacts bearing     the signs of belonging to a byegone age.         2
3The central feature would appear to be a vast    machine, from which project a number of bars     2
3of apparently great weight and strength, not     unlike the levers one might have found in an old 2
1fashioned signal box.                                                                             2

3Fighting a losing battle to prevent your little  boat from being swept downstream, you set off    2
1across the great river.                                                                           2
3Even all that fancy sub-aqua gear doesn't make   you a champion swimmer.                          2
3You wade out into the fast running waters, tryinghard (and failing miserably) not to be swept     2
1gradually downstream by the fierce current.                                                       2
3From this new vantage point, the precise nature  of those log-like objects is all too clear.  They2
3are little groups of crocodiles, and the nearest group seem to be taking an unhealthy interrest in2
1you - they are coming this way ! %0                                                               2
2Try as you might, you can make no headway        upstream.                                        2
3You have no choice I'm afraid, you are being     swept steadily further downstream with every     2
1moment that passes.                                                                               2
2At last you are in sight of the far bank.  The   crocs are gaining on you though.                 2
3The nearest (and fiercest) crocodile gives a     sudden spurt.  For a moment your terror gives way2
2to wonder that the creature can move so fast.    Then he is upon you and it is all over.          2

3mountain range.  The north seems brighter than   other directions, and it looks as if there may be2
2a small gap in the mountains just slightly east  of due north from your current vantage point.    2
3You now find yourself on a narrow strip of land  bordered by mountains to your west, and a river  2
3to the east and south.  To the north, the terrainseems to get more and more rugged and            2
1mountainous, and seems to ascend sllightly.                                                       2
1You are at the bend in the river again.                                                           2
3As you proceed north, the terrain seems to get   more and more rugged, and you seem to be climbing2
3all the time with small craggy hills on either   side.  When the scenery finally opens out, you   2
2realise you must have ascended several hundred   feet.                                            2
3The small plateau on which you now find yourself is bordered to the west by a deep ravine.  About 2
3two hundred feet below you in the bottom of the  ravine, is a fast flowing river with a narrow    2
3strip of vegetation on either side.  To the      north, the imposing face of the northern mountain2
2range seems very close now, and those to the     east are not very far off.                       2
1You are on the small plateau by the great gorge.                                                  2
3The steady climb seems long and arduous.  When   it finally levels out, you find that the scenery 2
2is now very different from that which you left   behind.                                          2
3You are on a small plateau, hemmed in on the westby vast mountains, and on the east by a deep     2
3gorge through which a great river can be seen    flowing from north to south way down about 200   2
1feet below you.                                                                                   2
3You have arrived at the eastern mountain range.  There is a tiny cave in the rock face, the       2
1entrance being only about two feet across.                                                        2
3The cave is no bigger than a small box room, but somehow much more claustrophobic.  You reflect   2
2that the sturdy rock walls on all sides must be  literally thousands of feet thick.               2
3You have arrived at the point where the northern and eastern mountains merge.  Imposing faces     2
1of sheer rock rise up on two sides.                                                               2
3You are on a small plateau.  To your west is a   deep gorge with river running far down below, and2
3to the north the imposing face of the mountains. The mountain face is broken however by a large   2
1cave entrance.                                                                                    2
3You are at the north west corner of a plateau.   To your east is a deep gorge with a fast flowing 2
3river running in its base, whilst to your north  a bleak and imposing mountain face is broken only2
3by a narrow archway leading into some            subterrainean complex.  Mountains hem you in to  2
1the west as well.                                                                                 2

3The path seems to take you steadily downwards,   and as you go, vegetation becomes more and more  2
1plentiful, and the air gets warmer.                                                               2

3You are in the middle of the river and rapidly   being swept downstream.  All around you are      2
2small groups of crocodiles who seem to be taking an unhealthy interest in you.                    2

3You are interupted by the return of the natives. Babbling excitedly they quickly surround you,    2
2bind you hand and foot, and hurle you into the   boiling cook pot.                                2

3Struggling against your bonds, you manage to get the bottle to your lips.  The elixir has a       2
3startling effect.  Suddenly the soup seems hot   no more, and with a great roar that sends natives2

3As it happens, 'help' is a very rude word in the language of these natives, and he who utters it  2

3You are in the southwest corner of a vast        underground chamber.  There is a great fissure   2
3running from east to west, right across the      centre of the chamber, and the whole area is lit 2

1east.                                                                                             2
2You are in the south west corner of the chamber. There is an opening in the south wall.           2
3The passage turns through 90 degrees here, and   continues westwards and northwards.  In the east 2
2wall there is a narrow crack about a foot across and about ten feet high.                         2
2You have reached another bend in the passageway. The tunnel proceeds to the west and south.       2
3This place was obviously once a cross roads.     The north and west passages have however both    2
3been blocked by an enormous land slide and are   plugged by a wall of boulders and rubble that    2
1looks as if it could be several feet thick.                                                       2
3You are at the end of a narrow passage which     enters this place from the north.  The west wall 2
2however is broken by a tall thin crack about a   foot across and running from floor to ceiling.   2
3You are on the southern edge of the fissure.     Looking down, the source of heat and light       2
3becomes obvious.  About thirty feet below you, anangry sea of molten lava is bubbling and boiling,2
2radiating heat and light up through the fissure  into the chamber above.                          2
3You are on the northern edge of the fissure.     Way down below you, inside the crack, the source 2
1of heat and light is                                                                              2
1You are in the north west corner of the chamber.                                                  2
3You are in the north east corner of a vast       vast underground chamber.  The chamber is bathed 2
3in an earie flickering red glow emmanating from  a great fissure, about ten feet across, which    2
3runs from the east wall right across to the west splitting the great chamber in two.  The air is  2
3warm and heavy with the smell of sulphur and is  would be most unpleasant but for the cooler      2
1breeze coming from a hole in the north wall.                                                      2
2You are in the north east corner of the chamber. there is an aperture in the north wall.          2
3The passage continues north for some distance    before suddenly turning to the right to emerge   2
1into a small low cavern.                                                                          2
3The chamber is only very dimly lit by a          flickering red glow from a coridoor leading off  2
3to the east.  In the dim light, you can just makeout two other passages leading off to north and  2
1west.                                                                                             2
3The passage turns sharply left, then continues   for some distance before a low archway brings you2
1out into the open air.                                                                            2
3There is a sharp bend in the passage here, and   you note the great contrast between the warmth   2
2of the southern passage and the fresh cool breezecoming from the west.                            2
3The passage opens out here, and in some strange  strong light, the source of which is not obvious,2
3the walls and ceiling shine with the brilliance  of cut glass.  They are not made of glass        2
3however, they are made of great clusters of      sapphires and emeralds, many of them as large as 2
3walnuts, and each twinkling out that promise of  untold riches that has driven men to war, crime  2
1or madness, since history began.                                                                  2

3somewhere along the edge of this cliff whereat   a natural fissure appears in the rock floor.     2
3This has the remarkable property that any item   dropped therethrough is transported by some      2
3mystic agency to my mountain base.  When this    mode of transport was tried on a mouse however,  2
3it brought about the poor creature's demise, and it arrived with all trace of life extinguished.  2
