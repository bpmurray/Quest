Traditional e       21hospitality being what it is, he invites you in.                                                23You are now in old Bert's house.

Bert is rightly upset and shows you the door.  23T is (as always in an elvish household)        magnificent.  The traditional 27 different       23coues are all served with the necessary pomp   and ceremony. The dishes range from the piquant  23pickl subterranian mushrooms in oak root sauce to the rare and succulent delicacy of boiled     23arboronars in jelly.

I hope you remembered to remove your  small change from your back pocket!              23Ayour senses slowly recover, after the spell inhigh 'g', you notice that the rocket is in orbit 22rou the moon. You also notice that there is a  hatch above you, reading 'lunar landing module'. 21You'rin the landing module.                                                                     21You areitting in the lunar landing module.                                                      21You're inhe control module.                                                                     23In responseo your command, the landing module  separates from the main body of the rocket and,  23under computeguidance, spirals in towards the  moon.

In front of you are three doors, labelled        21  "Ladies"  "Gentlemen"  and  "Receion".                                                        21You're back in the entrance hall.                                                               2HELP?   20585GUODXOS 21631SOX ?   61960                                                          73There is a loud yell as the dreaded maskesock  crashes through the wall.

Two large cliffs have risen up to east22andest and seem to be getting closer the       further you go.                                  23You a in a narrow valley running from north to south.  Two high and sheer cliff walls enclose   22you to e east and west, and the sound of your  footsteps echoes eerily between the two cliffs.  23After a srt distance, the cliffs move closer   still until you can actually touch both walls    22simultaneouy with your hands.  A few yards     further and the two cliffs actually join.        23You are standg in the "v" shape formed by two  enormous cliffs.  There is a small aperture to   22the north wherehey join, but it is scarcely    big enough to admit a human hand.                23The light from thsky is suddenly extinguished. Several pink and green flashes are visible but   23they seem as if thecould be coming from inside your own head.  An incredible feeling of vertigo 23and nausea overtakes u as you become completelydisoriented and collapse onto the ground.        23  Minutes if not hours ss before your senses   finally return.  When you pick yourself up and   23look around, you are in cplete darkness except for a small chink of light to the south.  On     23looking through this apertu you can see open   air the other side of it.  Your wand lies the    22other side of the crack, tantisingly out of    reach.                                           23As you move southwards, the clis recede into   the distance, and a small brook approaches from  21your right hand side.                                                                           21You are at the joining of the cliffalls.                                                        22You are on a cold and windy plain.

The sole exception being the east wall which     23contains the only door, and a large portraiof  a genial looking old wizard.  The tomes which    23line the walls are very dusty, which makes on  wonder if any have been read for several years.  23The green leather chairs are in contrast       spotless, and the dark wooden tables placed here 22and there boast a shine that only daily polishinguld maintain.                                  21You are in the library.                                                                         23The most peculiar feature of the room must surelybe hever the centre section of the north wall. 22At this point the bookcase has swung forward to  reveal secret passageway.                      23As you try to withdraw the book, you realise thatit is acally a cunningly disguised lever.

The occupant is    (unfortunately) not present, b discarded items 23of clothing scattered here and there tend to     indicate that she is in the habiof dressing in 23the manner of a byegone age (and in rather a     hurry !).  There are no windows, b the light   23from a small gas lamp reveals a small bed againstthe north wall, and a wardrobe again the west  21wall.  The main door is to the east.                                                            21You are now in the wardrobe.                                                                    23You are on the landing overlooking what looks    like a saloon bar plucked straight from thdays 23of the wild west.  A flight of wooden steps leadsdown into the bar area where all manner of rgh 23cowboy types are laughing, drinking and talking. The only other exit from the landing appears t 21be a small door to the west.                                                                     2Behind the bar there is a flight of wooden stairsleading up to the first floor landing.           2ou are on the landing again.                                                                     23Sdenly the back wall of the wardrobe swings    open and the floor tips, ejecting you            21uncemoniously through the aperture.                                                             23You a in semi darkness.  The small amount of   light coming from an opening to the west reveals 22that toour north is a small wooden door in the rock face beside which is a life sized painting  21of an elfielding an axe.                                                                        21of an elf.                                                                                      23For a moment,he elf and the axe take on an     almost lifelike quality.  You can hardly believe 23your eyes when e elf drops his axe on the floorwith a clang before once more becoming a mere    21painting.                                                                                       22You are in semi daress.  You can just make out however a solid wall to the east.                23You are on a very narw ledge on the east face  of an enormous rock wall.  The cold rock face    23is totally unclimable ave you, but there seem  to be a few footholds here and there below.  The 23way down looks very long d perilous however,   and the bottom is out of sight, hidden by the    22cold mist that pervades theast open chamber to the east.                                        23  The ledge itself continues broken northwards as far as the eye can see.  To the south, the    23ledge terminates abruptly at a all wooden door in the rock face that marks the southern end of  21the vast chamber.                                                                               23As you emerge through the door,  thcontrast is breathtaking.  A moment ago you were in a small  23warm but cramped room.  Suddenly now wever,    the ceiling and right hand wall are no more, and 21the air is cold and crisp like a winter night.                                                  23The ledge continues and the scenery remai much as before - rugged, vast and breathtaking.  A    23vast torrent of water is cascading down fro    somewhere high up in the roof and thundering down23into the abyss below.  Over the eons, the spr  has etched a small alcove in the rock face to    23your west.  The ledge however must be of harderrock because it continues both north and         23southwards as far as the eye can see.  The spray om the waterfall keeps the rock continually    22dampened making it slippery and thus unclimable  bo above and below.                            23The ledge itself continues southwards as far as  the e can see.  To the north however it        22vanishes through a low archway in the wall that  marks e northern end of this vast open chamber.22You are on a narrow ledge on the face of the     enormousliff wall opposite a waterfall.        23In the small alcove, the noise of the waterfall  is slightlless deafening, but it is still very 21cold and damp, and the floor is wet.                                                            21nine foot long solid oak plank.                                                                 22seven foot long solid oak plank with one rather  chewed up end.                                 22You are at the south end of the narrow ledge on  the cliff wall.                                22You are at the north end of the narrow ledge on  the cliff wall.                                22243522435238523853                              INTO BOUDOIR                                    6238723871                        C0322436C0422437C0922437C1022436E                               3239323981                        C0422435C0621173C0922435E                                       3239223921                        C032243510122438C1022435E                                       32235022350239923993                              FALL OUT OF WARDROBE                            61The door opens easily                                                                           21The door is not locked                                                                          2OPENDOOR12439UNLODOOR12440TRY HAND12439PUSHDOOR12439                                             72244322443241624163                              ONTO LEDGE                                      62409243212413            * KR2441C0122444C0222350C0622700C0922235E                               3241924271                        C0122446C0222443C0422445C0922445E                               3242824281                        C0322444C1022444E                                               324092433124252425                C0122451C0222444C0622762C1022451E                               33You are in a small dusty cave.

The cubicle contains a small 21empty wooden table.                                                                             22The glass is strongly re-inforced and thus       completely unbreable.                          21There is no way into the cubicle.                                                               21You must be joking - it is a fixture.                                                           2249524981    2499        * KR2542C0122543C0522543C0222454E                                       3LAY PLAN22544USE PLAN22544DROPPLAN22544CARRPLAN22546CROWSAGA12799                                72254922698    25002                              STAIRS COLLAPSE ?

The tunnel runs from east to  west, but theris a fair sized crack in the     21south wall.                                                                                     22You are in the tunnel of rats, and there is a    crack in the southall.                         23Through this aperture you can just make out a    number of figures drsed in blue uniforms.      23They seem to have formed some sort of road block and are standing behina large sign marked:%1   23 "official elvic police road block.%1              The elvic crown has be stolen - please%1     22  co-operate with police to secure arrest of%1     culprits."%1                                 23As you arrive at the road block, the police stop and search you.  On finding thing of interest  21however, they let you pass.                                                                     23On arrival at the road block, the police stop youand search you.  There is a greadeal of        23uproar when the elvic crown is found about your  person, and it is confiscated, andou are       21whisked off in a police car, sirens blaring.                                                    23You are in darkness again.  Only a faint green   glow from the east reveals that there  a door  22to the south.  There is also a rather unpleasant smell coming from a vaguely northerly diction. 22The door slams shut behind you, as if of its own volition.                                      23You are in a small box room.  There is a stout   wooden door to the north, and a dusty passag   21leading off to the east.                                                                        21You are in the box room.                                                                         3It is quite a long crawl.  On several occaions   it looks as if the passage is going to get too   2ow or too narrow to permit further progress, butsomehow you manage to wriggle through.  Finally  21y emerge into somewhat less cramped conditions.                                                 23Youre in a vast underground chamber.  The chasmis so tall, that clouds are visible high up above23you. ou seem to be in the south west corner of this chamber, but any progress north is          23impossie, because a torrent of water from      somewhere way up above you is thundering down    23to crash to a turbulent underground lake to    your north.  There is however a small opening in 22the west wa, and the wall itself looks as if   it may be climbable.                             22You are in thsouth east corner of the giant    chamber.                                         23You are in the uth east corner of the vast     chamber.  Progress north is still impossible     22due to the enormo waterfall, and the east wall at which you have arrived is totally unscalable. 22You are in the soutwest corner of the vast     chamber.                                         23I wouldn't advise anyttempt to progress north, you would surely perish under the thunderous     21might of that waterfall                                                                         23You have arrived in a sma room which seems to  have a choice of three exits.  The south wall    23contains a small archway thugh which a bright  green glow is shining.  The floor of this        23southern passage seems to be vered with molten metal, but strangely no heat can be felt.  To the23east, there is a ragged crack ithe wall, whilstto the north, there is another passage leading   21off.                                                                                            23You are in the small room with exitof some     sort or another leading off to west, south and   21north.                                                                                          23The northern exit however is guarded by most   fearsome brute.  A large two headed dog, both    22heads growling fiercely is standing in th      opening.                                         23The axe describes a graceful arc, and neatl    slices off both heads from the guardian of the   21north passage.                                                                                  22The two headed dog bars your way with an even  fiercer growl.                                   22The passage continues north a little way before  rning to the west.                             23You are on the east side of an eight foot round  po of boiling oil.  The passage obviously      23continues the other side, but it is too far to   jumps there is not much of a ledge the other   21side.                                                                                           23As you step into the green glow, the elvic crown melts inour hand without so much as a single   21degree raised in temperature.                                                                   23You are in a small l-shaped room lit by a bright green glow fm above.  There is a pool of cool  22but molten metal on the floor.

The own was said   23to possess many magic qualities, and protect its wearer from all manner of evils.  reover when  23king Dronwed died in the 49th winter of the      rain era, it was reported that his sl had been 23transported to the crown, and that the crown was therefore possessed of its own free wi and thus23has the power to resist any attempt to remove it from the inner sanctum.                        23 However,to encourage the spirit of the true     adventurer, the wizard Idris declared (appently23with the late Dronwed's approval) that there     would be one path left to allow a true         23adventuring spirit to take the crown for his own,provided only that he look after it carefully d23agree to cherish the memory of good king Dronwed,defending that name against all insult          3for the rest of his life.

He speaks " Thank    23you for finding my precious stone. I must have   left iin the - er - library.

All round the walls are pots of       flowers of every hue and fgrance.  In the midst22of these flowers is a white wooden box, in the   shape somewhat reminiscent oan eastern pagoda. 21Please leave the flowers alone.                                                                 23Why did you take the lid off the beehive?????

The walls and ceiling are a uniform grey and seem to 23be  some way insubstantial, like cobwebs. The  door through which you have entered is no longer 23visib: the only exit is a perfectly round hole in the floor. In the exact centre of the room is 22a marblpillar, about the height of a man...                                                     21The pillais quite definitely immovable.                                                         22You slide dn a steel tube and emerge, blinking,into the sunlight.                               23The room you ve entered reminds you, in a      curious way, of a waxworks. All around the walls 23are fully inflad, inflatable women. Whoever    made these figures really knew his business :    23they are uncannillifelike. Unfortunately, his  choice of model has lessened the erotic impact,  22somewhat.

The path runs from north to      south,nd on either side, thick bands of        21delicate ferns sway gently in the warm breeze.                                                  23Unfortunately, the picturesque fronds are coveredwith hundrs and hundreds of microscopic        22stinging cells, and you stagger back with a      painful rashorming all over your arms and legs.23The ground underfoot is soft and rather marshy   here.  The surunding bushes are covered with   23tiny droplets of water which glisten brightly in the fierce sunlit.  Here and there, large muddy23puddles have formed, and as you walk, your feet  make unpleasant sqlching noises as the mud is  21forced up and over your shoes.                                                                  23You seem to have wandered into the marshes.  The heat is intense and thhumidity oppressive.     23Visibility is down to about five yards because ofthe thick steamy mist th pervades the entire   23area.  The soft sticky mud which covers the      ground seems to vary in deh, but for the most  22part it seems to come up to your knees, making   progress slow and tiring.                      21The mud seems to get worse to the east.                                                         21The mud seems to get worse to the south.                                                        21The mud seems to get worse to the north.                                                        21You are wandering in the marshes.                                                               23Suddenly the whole scene darkens and the heavens open.  You have been caught in one of ose      23sudden tropical rainstorms.  In a matter of      seconds you are soaked to the skin, and th the 23pounding of the deluge on your head driving away all sense of reason, you run in blind pani(and 23in who knows what direction ? ) seeking shelter. At last you find it, and you sit, panting, ithe23darkness and gathering your thoughts.  Then, justas suddenly as it started, the pounding of the 22rain stops and the sky lightens, enabling you to take stock of your surroundings.%1 %0           3You are in a small cave, illuminated by bright   sunlight pouring in through the entrance to the  2est.  Here and there on the floor there are     neat little piles of well picked and gnawed      23bes, and in one corner is a pile of large greenspeckled eggs.  Obviously there is something out 22the in the jungle that looks upon this cave as home ! %0                                        23As yogather up the bones, you are suddenly     interrupted by a nerve shattering roar.  You turn22to discer (to your horror) that the            owner/occupier of the cave has returned.         23The create in question would be describable as slightly resembling a mouse were it not for the  23fact that iis about fifteen feet from the floorto the tips of its ears!  Behind it, twenty feet 23of hefty tailwish angrily back and forth.      Its mouth opens to reveal two parallel rows of   23sharp teeth ling each jaw, and the fearsome    growl that emerges tells you that                22it had consideredhe bones to be its supper,    but now it has other plans.....                  23The great jaws opennce more, but what emerges  this time is not a roar, but a long snake like   23tongue which flicks o like a whiplash and      curles round you, dragging you screaming into    21that merciless mouth.                                                                           23The sharp teeth, each theize of a pickaxe, slamtogether, and after a brief moment of agony -    21blissful oblivion.                                                                              23With a loud gulp, the creaturswallows you wholeand you slide unceremoniously down that chimney  22like oesophagus to land with a lash in the     waiting gastric juices.                          23Suddenly you are interrupted by aerve          shattering roar.  you turn to find (to your      22horror) that the owner/occupier of e cave has  returned.                                        23You are floating in the caustic juiceinside    the stomach of the giant creature.  The stinging 23feeling all over you body tells you tha        unless you get out of here fast, you too will    23soon be nothing more than one of those se      digested and unrecognisable lumps of meat that   21can be seen bobbing about here and there.                                                       23Well - that seems to have had a rather startlg effect.  The creature has started to retch, the  23gastric juices swelling like a stormy ocean witeach convulsion.  A moment later, you are hurtled23out through that terrible mouth as the creature   violently sick.  Obviously however, the       23creature has no intention of letting you get     aw that easily, and it starts to lumber towards21you again menacingly.                                                                           23I'm afraid those gastric juices are starting to  get yo  Slowly you can fell your senses        21slipping....                                                                                    23You are at the edge of the jungle.  The ground   underfoot  soft and very wet, and seems to get 23worse to the west.  A thin band of open ground   runs from noh to south, whilst to your east    22is a tall cliff in which the mouth of a small    cave is visibl                                 23For several minutes you flee in fear for your    life, neither nocing nor caring which direction22you go in.  Finally you stop and fall to the     floor, panting andxhausted.                    23As you pick up the first egg, it starts to crack open and, to your amement, a mouse-like        21creature the size of an alsatian emerges.                                                       23Obviously these creatures are carnivorous from   birth, because with a mi blowing squeal, the   23baby launches itself at you, sinking its         double rows of knife like eth deep into your   21flesh.                                                                                          22The baby gives a squeak of fear before running   out of the cave in fright.                     22The ground here is damp and marshy, and the      humidity oppressive.                           23You are at the edge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground running from rth to south.21A vast cliff face rises to your east.                                                           23After a few feet, one of the scanty foot holds   collapses under your weight, and you a         21deposited on the ground amid a pile of debris.                                                  23I'm afraid you missed your footing and fell.  At the foot of the cliff, your head strikes aarge 21rock, and it is all over.                                                                       22You are clinging by your toes and finger tips to a vast rock wall.                              22You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face which rises sheer to the north and east.   2You seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face, which rises sheer to south and east.       2ou seem to have reached a corner in the cliff   face, which rises sheer to south and west.       23Y are at the edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from east to west.  21A vt cliff face rises to the north.                                                             23You a at the edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from east to west.  21A vast iff face rises to the south.                                                             23You are athe edge of the jungle on a narrow    strip of open ground running from north to south.21A vast clifface rises to the west.                                                              23You are at thedge of the jungle, on a narrow   strip of open ground that continues southwards.  23To the west the is a vast cliff face, through  a hole in which the wide and fast flowing river  21(which is to the rth of you) vanishes.                                                          23You are wading up tyour waist in a wide and    fast flowing river.

How do u open a      locked door (without damaging it) when you do'nt 21have the correct key ?                                                                          22You now find yourself in a little cleing in thejungle.                                          23In front of you there is a most curiousachine. Shaped not unlike a motor cycle, with saddle and 23a dashboard (complete with several dials d a   large white lever) it is a most delicate and     23intricate apparatus.  There is ivory in it,nd  some transparent crystalline substance.  It looks23to be singularly askew, and it contains sever  bars, one of which has an odd twinkling          21appearance, making it seem somehow unreal.                                                      23You seem to reel, and get a nightmare sensation   falling.  It passes quickly however, and when 23you recover, you look up to see that the clouds  armoving across the sky at terrific speed as   23if in some freak wind.  The path of the sun      acro the heavens is also being executed at     23great speed which is constantly increasing, untilit beces just a blurred streak.  Suddenly it   23is night - then just as suddenly, the following  day.  Nit follows day follows night in an      23ever faster blur, until the flickering becomes   too fast tpercieve.  All around you, trees are 23growing from seedlings to giant forests in the   twinkling ofn eye, and most other motion       22proceeds too quickly for you to percieve, whilst the dials on t dashboard spin at great speed.  23You cling grimly to the saddle and watch in      amazement as youre flung headlong through time 21itself.                                                                                         23For a moment your head reels and you feel as if  you are falling, buthe experience is           23transitory.  Looking up you see that the sun has begun to move across t heavens at noticeable   23speed travelling from west to east, and that it  is moving faster by the ment.  The dials in    23front of you are spinning round clockwise, and   moments later, it is night Then, just as       23suddenly, it is day again, then night, and so on in ever faster succession unl they become a    23mere flickering before ceasing to be perceivable.All around you, vast forest shnk back into the 23ground, before new trees leap in an instant to   take their place.  All other motn in the       22outside world flashes past so quickly that you   can not see it.                                23The machine seems to lurch violently, and you areflung headlong from it to land head er heels on22to the ground.  Still dazed, you stagger to your feet, and start to look around.                23The machine is still there beside you, but the   jungle seems to have taken on a strangel       23prehistoric air.  A screech from above makes you look up.  High above you, a pair of pterodtyls 23can be seen circling in the sky.  Then a great   roar brings your eyes back to earth. %1        23  Approaching you from the nearby trees at great haste is a living specimen of tyranosaurus rex 21saliva dripping from its great jaws.                                                             3You leap onto the saddle, but the monster is     still there - nearly upon you, its great jaws are2pening ready to devour you !                                                                     23T late !  T. Rex is upon you.  You have time   only to think "Mark Bolan all is forgiven",      22befe you become just another snack between     meals.                                           23You a seated comfortably on the saddle.  In    front of you are several dials, and a large white22lever wch is unmarked, but looks as if it couldmove in either direction.                        21The levers over as far as it will go.                                                           23Your journethrough time continues - then       suddenly you realise (too late) that you have    22shot back to time before the earth existed.    That of course means there is no atmosphere..... 23Your journey thugh time continues, but slowly  the flickering returns and you realise that the  23rotation of the eth is slowing down.           Eventually the sun comes to rest, just a few     23degrees above the hizon.  Then suddenly - the  ageing star swells to a super nova - the earth   22and you along with itre instantaneously        consumed in an explosion of cosmic proportions.  23You realise of course tt dismounting from a    moving time machine is a bit like jumping down   23off an Inter-city 125 in ll flight.  Your      molecules hit the waiting universe at a speed    22of about 42 years per hypercond and are dashed to smithereens.                                  23You are on a soft, newly mownawn, edged with   rhododendron bushes.  Two buildings are visible. 23To the east there is a huge buiing with        intricate parapets and tall columns, and a large 23open portal that yawns shodowy anmysterioius.  To the south is a veritable palace built         23apparently of green porcelain. %1                You can also see, to the north and slightly    22west, a large white sphinx set upon aedestal   the size of a house.                             23You are on the lawn roughly equidistantrom the sphinx, the palace of green porcelain, and the   21large building with yawning portal.                                                             21Your time machine is standing right beside u.                                                   23Of your time machine however, there is no tra. Instead, there is a deep furrow running across   22the grass, and vanishing under the great bronzedoors in the plinth beneath the white sphinx.    22You have arrived just to the east of the great   ite sphinx.                                    22In the pedestal are two great bronze doors,      fily shut.                                     22The great bronze doors however are mysteriously  openas if someone is almost inviting you in.   22I'm afraid that way would take you into the      rhododdrons.                                   23You are now in the palace of green porcelain.    It appea to be some sort of museum, full of    23all manner of machines and artifacts bearing     the signs  belonging to a byegone age.         23The central feature would appear to be a vast    machine, frowhich project a number of bars     23of apparently great weight and strength, not     unlike the levs one might have found in an old 21fashioned signal box.                                                                           23000010339        1                              FLIP STATE IF 1, EL DON'T UNDERSTAND            62178610339        1                              CAN ONLY MOUNT MACHINIF IT IS THERE             63The lever moves slightly, and for a moment the   machine takes on a strge ghostly appearance -  21then suddenly it is gone.                                                                       21The machine is much too bulky to be lifted.                                                     21Please don't do that - that machine is unique.                                                  2?

There is a great fissure   23running fm east to west, right across the      centre of the chamber, and the whole area is lit 23by the dulled glow that emanates from it.  The air is warm and heavy with the smell of sulphur. 22There is an arture apparently leading out into the open air in the south wall.                  23You are in the uth east corner of the chamber. There is a small passageway running off to the   21east.                                                                                           22You are in the soutwest corner of the chamber. There is an opening in the south wall.           23The passage turns thrgh 90 degrees here, and   continues westwards and northwards.  In the east 22wall there is a narrow ack about a foot across and about ten feet high.                         22You have reached another nd in the passageway. The tunnel proceeds to the west and south.       23This place was obviously on a cross roads.     The north and west passages have however both    23been blocked by an enormous ld slide and are   plugged by a wall of boulders and rubble that    21looks as if it could be severaleet thick.                                                       23You are at the end of a narrow paage which     enters this place from the north.  The west wall 22however is broken by a tall thin crk about a   foot across and running from floor to ceiling.   23You are on the southern edge of the fsure.     Looking down, the source of heat and light       23becomes obvious.  About thirty feet bel you, anangry sea of molten lava is bubbling and boiling,22radiating heat and light up through the fsure  into the chamber above.                          23You are on the northern edge of the fissure    Way down below you, inside the crack, the source 21of heat and light is                                                                            21You are in the north west corner of the chamber                                                 23You are in the north east corner of a vast       st underground chamber.  The chamber is bathed 23in an eerie flickering red glow emanating from   a eat fissure, about ten feet across, which    23runs from the east wall right across to the west spliing the great chamber in two.  The air is  23warm and heavy with the smell of sulphur and     would  most unpleasant but for the cooler      21breeze coming from a hole in the north wall.                                                    22You are in the north east corner of the chamber. there is aaperture in the north wall.          23The passage continues north for some distance    before suddey turning to the right to emerge   21into a small low cavern.                                                                        23The chamber is only very dimly lit by a          flickering red gw from a coridoor leading off  23to the east.
