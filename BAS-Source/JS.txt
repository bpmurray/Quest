Key Features of the Conversion:
Class-based structure - The entire game is encapsulated in a QuestGame class for better organization and reusability.

Modern JavaScript syntax - Uses ES6+ features like classes, arrow functions, async/await, and template literals.

Async game loop - The main game loop uses async/await to handle user input asynchronously, making it compatible with modern UI frameworks.

Callback-based I/O - Instead of direct console I/O, the game uses callbacks (onOutput and onInput) that you can connect to any UI system (web, terminal, React components, etc.).

Save/Load system - Implements JSON-based save/load functionality that works in any JavaScript environment.

All major systems implemented:

Room navigation and movement
Artifact pickup/drop/use
Gremlin (creature) AI and interactions
Combat and feeding systems
Conditional movement and puzzles
Scoring system
State management
How to Use:
javascript
const game = new QuestGame();

// Connect to your UI
game.onOutput = (text) => console.log(text);
game.onInput = async () => await getUserInput();

// Load data and start
game.setDataRecords(yourGameData);
game.initializeGame();
game.loadGameData();
await game.startGameLoop();
The code maintains the original game logic while modernizing the structure and making it much more maintainable than the original spaghetti code!
